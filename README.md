## Project Overview
Phish Analyzer is a **heuristic-based phishing email simulator and analyzer** built using **Python and Streamlit**.  

It is designed to help:
- **Non-technical users** understand phishing risks.
- **Security enthusiasts** analyze email campaigns.
- **Students & professionals** simulate phishing campaigns for learning purposes.

With this tool, you can **upload email CSV logs** or **simulate campaigns**, analyze risk levels, and get **actionable advice** for safe email behavior.

---

## Features
- **CSV-based analysis:** Supports GoPhish CSV exports or any email dataset.
- **Simulate phishing campaigns:** Randomly generate emails with clickable links and test user behavior.
- **Heuristic risk scoring:** Detect phishing emails based on keywords, link patterns, domain reputation, and click/report status.
- **Risk labels:** Low / Medium / High scoring with color-coded dashboard.
- **Domain summary:** Analyze suspicious domains used in emails.
- **Top risky recipients:** Easily identify high-risk users in campaigns.
- **User advice:** Suggest safe email practices.
- **Theme toggle:** Switch between light and dark mode for user comfort.
- **Export results:** Download analyzed CSV for reporting.

## Demo / Screenshots
### Example Dashboard
![Dashboard Screenshot](https://github.com/Chandan-kumar10/phish-analyzer/tree/main/phish-analyzer/Screenshorts))


- **Risk Distribution Pie Chart**: Visual overview of email risks.
- **Top Risky Recipients**: Sorted table for quick analysis.
- **Domain Summary**: Identify suspicious domains in email links.

---

## Installation
```
pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the app
```
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

Open the URL shown in terminal (usually(http://localhost:8501/)).

Use the sidebar to:

Simulate phishing emails or upload your own CSV.

Adjust number of emails, phishing fraction, click/report probabilities.

Edit keywords and suspicious domains.

Switch between light/dark mode.

View the dashboard:

Total emails, high-risk emails, reported emails.

Risk distribution pie chart.

Top risky recipients.

Domain summary.

Download the analyzed CSV if needed.

## How It Works

Keywords: Checks email subject/body for risky words (e.g., verify, urgent, account suspended).

Link Analysis: Flags suspicious domains, URL shorteners, and IP-based URLs.

User Behavior: Clicking a link increases risk, reporting decreases risk.

Risk Scoring: Combines all heuristics to generate a score (0–100) and assign a label (Low / Medium / High).
